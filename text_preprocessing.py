# first paragraph of The Gold Bug, by Edgar Allen Poe
#test = '''MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand.
#He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but
#a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want. To avoid the
#mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the
#city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivanâ€™s Island,
#near Charleston, South Carolina. This Island is a very singular one.
#It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three
#miles long. Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is
#separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its
#way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the
#marsh hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least
#dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the western
#extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable
#frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from
#Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto;
#but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and
#a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense
#undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists
#of England. The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty
#feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with
#its fragrance.'''
